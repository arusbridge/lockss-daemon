/* 
 *   The same functional link can have variants based on the URL of the referring page
 *   We want to normalize these to be the same to avoid duplicate functional pages with minor URL differences.
 *   Specifically, 
 *      The citation landing page url is of the form:
 *      <base_url>/citation.asp?issn=X;year=Y;volume=Q;issue=P;spage=N;epage=M;aulast=foo
 *          but may also have one or both of the following additional arguments
 *          aid=<article_identifier>
 *          type=1
 *       depending on the url of the referring article page (type informs aspect; aid is sometimes there)
 *    In this specific case, we want to remove the type argument but we cannot always remove it because it is
 *    a necessary part of an article aspect url.
